# Mah Ying Qi's Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS.

I am constantly updating this website to showcase my latest projects and skills.

It is hosted using github pages and can be accessed at [https://mahyingqi123.github.io/PortfolioSite/]


## Future Expansion

I plan to extend this website with database and backend api to support more content and features.

- Visitor counter
- More games
- Blog posts
- More info about myself
